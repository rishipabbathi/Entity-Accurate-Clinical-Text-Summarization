# **Entity-Accurate Clinical Summarization**

### *Hallucination Mitigation for Medical NLP*

##  **Overview**

This project delivers an Entity-Accurate Clinical Summarization system designed to generate concise, factual summaries of patient notes while preventing the generation of false medical information (hallucination). By tightly coupling Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the summarization process, we ensure all critical clinical facts (diseases, drugs, symptoms) are retained and correctly attributed to the source document.

---

##  **Motivation**

Reading clinical documents is challenging for speed and safety:

*  **Time-consuming**: Clinical notes and discharge summaries are long and complex.
*  **Safety Risk**: Standard Large Language Models (LLMs) used for summarization frequently hallucinate facts, which can lead to misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment plans in a healthcare setting.
*  **Goal**: Build a system that provides concise, safe, and trustworthy summaries, validated at the entity level.

---

##  **Problem Statement**

Develop an NLP pipeline that converts raw clinical notes into a **short**, **coherent**, and **factually consistent summary** while meeting three core requirements:

* **Entity Retention**: Must retain all critical medical entities (DRUG, DISEASE, SYMPTOM, PATIENT) present in the source.
* **Factual Consistency**: Ensure zero hallucination of medical entities in the final output.
* **Readability**: Summaries must be clinically meaningful and easy to interpret.

---

##  **Proposed Pipeline**
The system integrates a sequence of steps to ensure accuracy and safety.

### **1. Document Preparation & NER Training**

* **Dataset**: MIMIC-III Demo Dataset (simulated).
* **NER Model**: BioBERT (simulated by a rule-based matching system in the web demo, trained in the notebook).
* **Action**: Extract all key entities (PATIENT, SYMPTOM, DISEASE, DRUG) from the source note.

### **2. Entity-Guided Summarization**

* **Model**: Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model (T5/BART, simulated via Gemini API).
* **Action**: The extracted entities are explicitly added to the LLM's prompt to force the model to prioritize and include these facts in the generated summary.

### **3. Hallucination Mitigation & Verification**

* **Method**: A crucial post-generation check (Step 4 from the pipeline).
* **Action**: The NER model is re-run on the generated summary to extract its entities. These are then compared against the source entities (Step 1).
* **Hallucination Rate**: Calculated as the percentage of entities in the summary that are not present in the source.
* **Mitigation**: If running in a full pipeline, stricter decoding or regeneration would be applied (simulated by metric display).

### **4. Entity Highlighting**

* **Presentation**: Client-side JavaScript/CSS.
* **Action**: Entities that pass the verification check are visually highlighted in the final summary (color-coded by type) for fast clinical review.

##  **Expected Outcomes**

* **Web Demo**: A deployable HTML/JavaScript application demonstrating the full NER and summarization pipeline.
* **High Factual Consistency**: Quantitative evaluation showing a significant reduction in hallucination rate compared to baseline LLMs.
* **Quick Reference**: Highlighted entities for rapid clinical assessment.
* **Complete Report** : Detailed analysis using entity-level metrics (Precision, Recall, F1) and ROUGE/BLEU scores.


##  **Applications**
